Statistics
==========

This main program (which uses the Die class unmodified) allows the user to specify a different number of faces on each die, terminated by entering 0.  Then it asks for the number of times to roll the specified dice. Finally, it rolls the dice and calculates the mean, median, and mode for the rolls of those mixed dice.

Explanations of some really simple statistics (look, no calculus!) may be found [here](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/).
