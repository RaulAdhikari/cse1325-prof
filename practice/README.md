Practice!
=========

Each of the directories above contains a coding challenge intended to give you additional practice in Object-Oriented Programming in C++. 

Each includes suggested solutions, and may contain suggestions for improvements or "crazy" challenges that should give you *lots* of practice.

And as always, ask questions. We *love* questions!
